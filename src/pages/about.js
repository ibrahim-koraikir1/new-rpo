      <p>
      My name is Boyana Tosheva and I was born in Sofia, Bulgaria.

Currently in my second year of Creative Business at Breda University of Applied Sciences. I enjoy various activities like drawing and doing yoga. Among my interests is creating something that brings joy to someone else. Being “the man behind the curtain” has become my dream for the last couple of years. I discovered this dream of mine while working on a different types of production and media oriented
projects. Being creative is something that in my opinion everyone is capable of, but many people struggle with visualizing and applying their ideas – something that I have manage to do because of my
mother. She is an artist – she has a master’s degree from the Academy for Arts in Sofia, Bulgaria, and she is one of my inspirations. She taught me that everything you think of can be materialized into the real world if you have the determination to make it happen.
